This is an additional tutorial to the re-implementation of *"Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention"* (Xu et al., 2016) (see [here](https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Image-Captioning)). 

There are some additional comments in the code, the code itself slightly refactored, we added a few notebooks with examples and debugging, we analyzed connection between the paper and the code and so on. See details in [the Medium post](https://medium.com/@ilyarudyak/show-attend-and-tell-4b146dd9df73).
